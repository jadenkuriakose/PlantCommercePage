# # Plant Commerce Page - Coursera Final Project

This is a simple plant commerce web application built with React and Vite as part of my Coursera final project. The app allows users to browse and purchase a variety of plants. It uses React for building interactive UI components and Vite for fast development and bundling. To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands in your terminal: 

1. `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. `npm run dev` to start the development server.

The app features plant listings, a shopping cart, localStorage, and basic navigation. For more information, check out the project files.
